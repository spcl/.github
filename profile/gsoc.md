# Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2023

The SPCL group will apply as an organization to the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) program
for our open-source projects in data-centric programming and serverless computing.
You can find here student project proposals, advice on applying, and introductions to
each project to start using our software.

## Student Proposals

Students interested in a project should get in touch with proposed mentors and discuss
the project ideas. We will provide a proposal template before the applications open.
All students are expected to conduct initial research into the topic, evaluate requirements,
and discuss potential solutions with mentors.
Active collaboration before the application is vital to a successful project proposal.

Students are expected to demonstrate the required level of programming skills.
Projects define their respective entry tasks that should be accomplished before the deadline of the application period.
