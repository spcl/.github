Students interested in a project should get in touch with proposed mentors and discuss the project ideas. We will provide a proposal template before the applications open. All students are expected to conduct initial research into the topic, evaluate requirements, and discuss potential solutions with mentors. Active collaboration before the application is vital to a successful project proposal.

Students are expected to demonstrate the required level of programming skills. Projects define their respective entry tasks that should be accomplished before the deadline of the application period.
